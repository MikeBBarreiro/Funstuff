            <h3 class="titleheader">WW2</h3>
                <p class="bodyp animated fadeInUp">Everyone knows the basic stuff of the second great war, unless they should.., but actually not everyone knows the war didnt start in 1941. World War 2 actually started in 1938, with Hitler and his large armies of crusaders blitzgrieging through Europe. taking countries with no sweat. After taking Austria-Hungry, hitlers home country, and all the other Neighboring Countries.There is also conflict in England as well! The current Prime minister resigns his position, do to the stress he couldnt handle, so then a tarnished man's reputation stands up for a chance to prove himseld once more, and that man was the ruthless Winsten Churchelle! As war breaks out across Europe, Hitler then takes France within 12 hours, and Great briton will not allow there allie to suffer this, so then prime minister Winsten Churchelle signs a, Deculeration of War. Great Briton now sets a defensive around there island with the most powerful navel power in the world. which leaves Hitler to stay and not advance to the well protected English.In America, Roosevelt Franklin just became president and is frighten for his people and the war. America doesn't want a war,because of the depression ruined so many peoples lifes,going out of the depression into a war isnt what the American people need.</p>
                <p class="bodyp2 animated fadeInUp">but American Cargo ships keep getting sunk in the Atlantic by German U-boats, Franklin HAS to do somthing about this! Soon enough, he will, Japan, want resources from the pacific and is move fast towards America. Japan sends the largest Airraid ever originized to a small island named Hawaii at Pearl Harbour..America losses half of there powerful navy and suffers great terrible lost. this enrages the american people and finally gives them a reason to take the fight to the axis power! A few hours later, America signs a war of Declaration to Japan and starts to immobilize. Just a few hours later, Germany Declares war on America, now the fight is on.America then taps into japans messages and cracks the code and finds out Japan is heading straight towards Midway, an American airfield island, so what does America do? Franklin D. Roosevelt pics Macarther, a top 5 star general that fought in the first great war, to lead the pacific campaign and bring the fight to the Japs. knowings whats to come Macarther sends a navy to Midway and waits for the enemy. While this goes on in the pacific, on the other side of the wold, Hitler decides he needs more living space, Hitler then suddenly sends one million troops towards Russia and invades his Allie. Joseph Stalin. Stalin is enraged from this betrayal, and seeks revenge, and he does get his revenge when the brutal Russian winter comes and send the Germans to a frozen halt from there advance. The German troops were not ready for this whether and most die from attrition. Stalin uses this chance to strike and sends the germans back for miles and miles. as this goes on for months, Germanys western front sends an air raid to England to attempt to stop the English bombings in strategic cites, this air raid will soon be known to become the battle of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Britain">Britain.</a>

                <p class="bodyp3 animated fadeInUp">In the Pacific, the <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/battle-of-midway">Battle of Midway</a> is about to begin.June 4-7th 1942, America wins the battle destroying most of Japans imperial fleet making a</p> 
                <p class="bodyp4 animated fadeInUp"> massiv important turning point in the Pacific war. America is now on the Offensive towards Japan, using a technique called Island hopping, General Macharthur sweeps through the pacific taking small island by island until he makes it to the major stratigic islands. Its now 1944 and the allies have organized an a massive offensive.Hitler is expecting it of course but he doesn't know where it will take place, he expects it to take place on the english channel, but he expected the Ally offensive to happen at calais because its closest to Germanys shorelines, so Hitler posted most of his bunkers and artillery north from normandy at calais.Which is north where the Invasion will happen, in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Normandy+france+ww2&tbm=isch&ei=iau4U6upHdieyATpioIQ#facrc=_&imgdii=_&imgrc=4JqQmNJNdjDVfM%253A%3Bhi1ZtLR-lNr-PM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.naval-history.net%252Fww2mR230Normandy.GIF%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.naval-history.net%252FWW2CampaignsNormandy.htm%3B692%3B417">Normandy France.</a> Two years have passed much has happened in the pacific and Europe as well. The Americans are closing in on Japans mainland with just a few islands away from the Empire of japan, and the soviets are still pushing back the German invaders further and further into there homeland. Now its time for America and the British to get a taste of the action in Europe</p>  
            <p class="bodyp5">Its time for the largest Amphibious invasion to ever happen devised by General Eisenhower,<a href="http://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/d-day"> D-Day </a>.On June 6th 1944, more then one million troops have landed on the beaches of Normandy.Ohmaha, Gold, Utah, Juno , and Sword were the codenames of the beach landings amserica, britain and canadian forces would get. It was the most brutal invasion young men would see, constant machine gun fire and artilarry barrages hit young soilders as they attempt to run through the water then up the beach, followed by a large airborn invasion as well which was know as the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Normandy">Invasion of Normandy</a>. The allies then paved a road of freedom towards France, liberating all of France on August 25th, 1944 leaving hitler, completely surrounded on all fronts. Italy had fallen months ago, Russia is right outside Germany, both the British and Americans are coming from the south west and north, with resistance fighters still in the action inside Germany itself. Not to mention there are some high ranking officers secertly trying to assasinant Hitler himself. Its now 1945, many battles have been fought inch by inch, Half of the pacific is being taken over by the American forces and Hitler is doing all he cant to keep both his western and eastern fronts from falling apart.
