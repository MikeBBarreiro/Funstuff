            <h3 class="titleheader">WW2</h3>
                <p class="bodyp">Everyone knows the basic stuff of the second great war, unless they should.., but actually not everyone knows the war didnt start in 1941. World War 2 actually started in 1938, with Hitler and his large armies of crusaders blitzgrieging through Europe. taking countries with no sweat. After taking Austria-Hungry, hitlers home country, and all the other Neighboring Countries.There is also conflict in England as well! The current Prime minister resigns his position, do to the stress he couldnt handle, so then a tarnished man's reputation stands up for a chance to proove himseld once more, and that man was the ruthless Winsten Churchelle! As war breaks out across Europe, Hitler then takes France within 12 hours, and Great briton will not allow there allie to suffer this, so then prime minister Winsten Churchelle signs a, Deculeration of War. Great Briton now sets a defensive around there island with the most powerful navel power in the world. which leaves Hitler to stay and not advance to the eel protected English.In America, Roosevelt Franklin just became president and is frighten for his people and the war. America doesn't want a war,America doesnt need this war to happen,</p>
                <p class="bodyp2">but American Cargo ships keep getting sunk in the Atlantic by German U-boats, Franklin HAS to do somthing about this! Soon enough, he will, Japan, want resources from the pacific and is move fast towards America. Japan sends the largest Airraid ever originized to a small island named Hawaii at Pearl Harbour..America losses half of there powerful navy and suffers great terrible lost. this enrages the american people and finally gives them a reason to take the fight to the axis power! A few hours later, America signs a war of Declaration to japan and starts to immobilize. Just a few hours later, Germany Declares war on America, now the fight is on.America then taps into japans messages and cracks the code and finds out Japan is heading straight towards Midway, an American airfield island, so what does America do? Franklin D. Roosevelt pics Macarther, a top 5 star general that fought in the first great war, to lead the pacific campaign and bring the fight to the Japs. knowings whats to come Macarther sends a navy to Midway and waits for the enemy.</p>
